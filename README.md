**Overview**
	This project aims to predict the status of a meteorite, determining whether it has possibly been found or fell but not found. By analyzing input data related to meteorite characteristics, the model can make informed predictions about the likelihood of a meteorite being discovered or remaining undiscovered.

**Features**
	Input Data Handling: The program accepts various meteorite-related data such as location coordinates, fall date, mass, velocity, and other relevant features.
	Prediction Model: Utilizes machine learning algorithms to classify the meteorite status as either "Found" or "Fell but Not Found."
	Visualization: Provides graphical representations of meteorite data and prediction outcomes.
